# Pre-SGTA Work  

## Working with Data in R  

### Understanding Data Types and Structures  

Load the `tidyverse` library and explore different R data types by running the code below. For each block, **predict the output before running it** and observe what `typeof()`, `class()`, and `str()` tell you.

#### Atomic Vectors - Doubles  

```{r atomic-vectors-doubles, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
x
typeof(x)
class(x)
str(x)

x <- 1:6
x
typeof(x)
class(x)
str(x)

x <- seq(1, 6, len = 6)
x
typeof(x)
class(x)
str(x)
```

**Your observations:**

- What differences do you notice between these three ways of creating vectors?
- Why might `typeof()` give different results?

*Write your thoughts here:*



#### Atomic Vectors - Integers  

```{r atomic-vectors-integers, eval=FALSE}
x <- c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L, 6L)
x
typeof(x)
class(x)
str(x)

x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5L, 6L)
x
typeof(x)
class(x)
str(x)

x <- as.integer(x)
x
typeof(x)
class(x)
str(x)
```

**Your observations:**

- What happens when you mix integers and doubles in a vector?
- What does the `L` suffix do?

*Write your thoughts here:*



#### Atomic Vectors - Characters  

```{r atomic-vectors-characters, eval=FALSE}
x <- "This"
x
typeof(x)
class(x)
str(x)

x <- c("This", "unit", "is", "great.", "Do", "you", "agree?")
x
typeof(x)
class(x)
str(x)

x <- paste("This", "unit", "is", "great.", "Do", "you", "agree?", sep = "::")
x
typeof(x)
class(x)
str(x)

x <- paste("This", "unit", "is", "great.", "Do", "you", "agree?", sep = " ")
x
typeof(x)
class(x)
str(x)

cat("This", "unit", "is", "great.", "Do", "you", "agree?", sep = "\t")
cat("This", "unit", "is", "great.", "Do", "you", "agree?", sep = "\n")
cat("This", "unit", "is", "great.", "\n", "Do", "you", "agree?")
cat("This ", "unit ", "is ", "great.", "\n", "Do ", "you ", "agree? ", sep = "")

glue::glue("This unit is great. Do you agree?")
glue::glue("This unit is great.
           Do you agree?")
```

**Your task:**

- Compare the different methods for combining strings
- What's the difference between `paste()`, `cat()`, and `glue()`?

*Write your analysis here:*



#### Atomic Vectors - Logicals  

```{r atomic-vectors-logicals, eval=FALSE, error=TRUE}
1 > 0
1 < 0
1 <- 1  # This will cause an error - why?
1 == 1

x <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
x
typeof(x)
class(x)
str(x)

x <- c(T, T, F)
x
typeof(x)
class(x)
str(x)

x <- 1 > 0
x
typeof(x)
class(x)
str(x)

x <- c(1 > 0, 5 > 0, 5 > 10)
x
typeof(x)
class(x)
str(x)
```

**Your task:**

- Explain why `1 <- 1` causes an error
- What's the difference between `=` and `==`?

*Write your explanation here:*



#### Factors  

```{r factors, eval=FALSE}
x <- c("spring", "spring", "winter", "spring", "winter", "spring", "spring")
x
typeof(x)
class(x)
str(x)
attributes(x)

x <- factor(c("spring", "spring", "winter", "spring", "winter", "spring", "spring"))
x
typeof(x)
class(x)
str(x)
attributes(x)
table(x)
as.character(x)
```

**Your analysis:**

- How are factors different from character vectors?

*Write your thoughts here:*



### Working with Matrices and Arrays  

#### Matrices  

```{r matrices, eval=FALSE}
m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2)
str(m)
class(m)
m

m <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
str(m)
class(m)
m
```

**Your task:**

- Explain the difference between the two matrix creations above
- How does R fill matrices by default?

*Write your answer here:*



#### Arrays  

```{r arrays, eval=FALSE}
x <- array(c(1:5, 11:15), dim = c(5, 5))
str(x)
class(x)
x
# R recycles values: we gave 10 values, but needed 25 (5*5)

x <- array(c(1:15, 21:30), dim = c(5, 5))
str(x)
class(x)
x

x <- array(c(1:15, 21:30, 101:125), dim = c(5, 5, 2))
str(x)
class(x)
x

x <- array(c(1:25, 101:125), dim = c(5, 5, 2))
str(x)
class(x)
x
```

**Your task:**

- What happens when you don't provide enough values for an array?
- How do 3-dimensional arrays work?

*Write your explanation here:*



### Working with Lists  

```{r lists, eval=FALSE}
x <- list(1:5, 11:15, c("a", "b", "c"))
str(x)
class(x)
x

x <- list(x1 = 1:5, x2 = 11:15, x3 = c("a", "b", "c"))
str(x)
class(x)
x

x <- list(x1 = 1:5, x2 = 11:15, x3 = list(y1 = "a", y2 = "b", y3 = "c"))
str(x)
class(x)
x
```

**Your task:**

- How are lists different from vectors?
- What are the advantages of named lists?

*Write your analysis here:*



### Working with Data Frames and Tibbles  

```{r data-frames, eval=FALSE}
# Traditional data frame
x <- data.frame(
  season = c("winter", "winter", "spring", "spring"),
  month = c("Jan", "Feb", "Apr", "Apr"), 
  station = c("Sydney", "Newcastle", "Sydney", "Melbourne"), 
  temperature = c(14, 17, 26, 25)
)
str(x)
typeof(x)
class(x)
x

# Modern tibble
x <- tibble(
  season = c("winter", "winter", "spring", "spring"),
  month = c("Jan", "Feb", "Apr", "Apr"), 
  station = c("Sydney", "Newcastle", "Sydney", "Melbourne"), 
  temperature = c(14, 17, 26, 25)
)
str(x)
typeof(x)
class(x)
x

# Tribble (transposed tibble for readability)
x <- tribble(
  ~season, ~month, ~station, ~temperature,
  "winter", "Jan", "Sydney", 14,
  "winter", "Feb", "Newcastle", 17,
  "spring", "Apr", "Sydney", 26,
  "spring", "Apr", "Newcastle", 25
)
glimpse(x)
typeof(x)
class(x)
x
```

**Your analysis:**

- What are the differences between data frames and tibbles?
- When would you use `tribble()` instead of `tibble()`?

*Write your thoughts here:*



## Loading and Saving Data  

Download the `test.csv` file from iLearn and place it in a `data` subfolder within your working directory. We'll then load the file using `read_csv()` and explore the available options.

### Reading Data  

```{r loading-data, eval=FALSE}
# Load CSV file
here::here("data", "test.csv") # Check the path first
x <- read_csv(file = here::here("data", "test.csv"))
str(x)
glimpse(x)
typeof(x)
class(x)
x

# Alternative using read_delim
x_delim <- read_delim(file = here::here("data", "test.csv"),
                      delim = ",")
waldo::compare(x, x_delim)
```

**Your task:**

- What information does `glimpse()` provide that `str()` doesn't?
- Are there any differences between `read_csv()` and `read_delim()` results?

*Write your observations here:*



### Writing Data  

```{r writing-data, eval=FALSE}
# Create sample data
weather_data <- tribble(
  ~season, ~month, ~station, ~temperature,
  "winter", "Jan", "Sydney", 14,
  "winter", "Feb", "Newcastle", 17,
  "spring", "Apr", "Sydney", 26,
  "spring", "Apr", "Newcastle", 25
)
str(weather_data)
weather_data

# Save to CSV file
write_csv(weather_data, 
          file = here::here("data", "my_weather_data.csv"))

# Verify by reading back
weather_check <- read_csv(here::here("data", "my_weather_data.csv"))
waldo::compare(weather_data, weather_check)
```

**Your task:**

- After running this code, check your `data` folder - what file was created?
- Why is it good practice to read the data back after saving?

*Write your thoughts here:*



### Selecting and Modifying Values  

#### Working with Vectors  

```{r vector-indexing, eval=FALSE}
# Vector indexing
seasons <- c("spring", "spring", "winter", "spring", "winter", "spring", "spring")
seasons[2]                    # Select second element
seasons[c(2, 3, 5)]          # Select multiple elements
seasons[2] <- "summer"       # Modify second element
seasons
seasons[-2]                  # Exclude second element
seasons[c(T, T, F, F, F, T, T)]  # Logical indexing
```


#### Working with Matrices  

```{r matrix-indexing, eval=FALSE}
# Matrix indexing
m <- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)
m
m[2, 3]                      # Row 2, column 3
m[2, c(1, 3)]               # Row 2, columns 1 and 3
m[2, 3] <- 99               # Assign new value
m

m[1:2, 1]                   # Rows 1-2, column 1
m[, 1]                      # All rows, column 1
m[, 1, drop = FALSE]        # Keep as matrix (don't drop dimension)

m[-2, ]                     # Exclude row 2
m[-2, -c(2, 3)]            # Exclude row 2, columns 2-3
m[c(T, F, T), ]            # Logical indexing for rows
```

#### Working with Data Frames and Tibbles  

```{r dataframe-indexing, eval=FALSE}
# Data frame indexing
weather <- tribble(
  ~season, ~month, ~station, ~temperature,
  "winter", "Jan", "Sydney", 14,
  "winter", "Feb", "Newcastle", 17,
  "spring", "Apr", "Sydney", 26,
  "spring", "Apr", "Newcastle", 25
)

weather[2, 3]               # Row 2, column 3
weather[2, c(1, 3)]         # Row 2, columns 1 and 3  
weather[3, 3] <- "Melbourne"  # Modify value
weather

weather[1:4, 1]             # Rows 1-4, column 1
weather[, 1]                # All rows, column 1 (returns tibble)
weather |> pull(1)          # Extract first column as vector
weather |> pull(season)     # Extract by name as vector

weather[-2, ]               # Exclude row 2
weather[-2, -c(2, 3)]      # Exclude row 2 and columns 2-3
weather[c(T, F, T, T), ]   # Logical indexing

weather$temperature         # Access column by name
weather$temperature[2]      # Second element of temperature
weather$temperature[2] <- 16  # Modify temperature value
weather
```


#### Working with Lists  

```{r list-indexing, eval=FALSE}
# List indexing
data_list <- list(1:5, 11:15, c("a", "b", "c"))
data_list
data_list[[1]]              # First element (as vector)
data_list[[2]]              # Second element
data_list[[3]][2]           # Second element of third component
data_list[[3]][c(2, 3)]     # Multiple elements

# Named lists
named_list <- list(x1 = 1:5, x2 = 11:15, x3 = c("a", "b", "c"))
named_list
named_list[[1]]             # By position
named_list$x2               # By name
named_list$x3[2]           # Element within component
named_list$x3[c(2, 3)]     # Multiple elements

# Nested lists
nested_list <- list(x1 = 1:5, x2 = 11:15, x3 = list(y1 = "a", y2 = "b", y3 = "c"))
nested_list
nested_list$x3$y2          # Access nested element
nested_list$x3$y2 <- "house"  # Modify nested element
nested_list
```


### Dealing with Missing Values  

#### Understanding NA  

```{r missing-values, eval=FALSE}
# Working with NA
1 + NA                      # What happens with missing data?
x <- NA
x
str(x)
is.na(x)                    # Test for missing values
NA == NA                    # Why doesn't this work?
is.na(NA) == is.na(NA)     # Proper way to compare

# More examples
values <- c(1, 2, NA, 4, 5)
is.na(values)               # Which are missing?
sum(values)                 # What happens?
sum(values, na.rm = TRUE)   # Remove missing values
mean(values, na.rm = TRUE)  # Same for mean
```


# Data Wrangling with dplyr  

## Introduction to dplyr  

Load the `babynames` dataset and explore the main dplyr verbs. Each verb performs a specific data manipulation task.

### Basic dplyr Operations  

```{r dplyr-basics, eval=FALSE}
library(babynames)
library(tidyverse)

# Explore the data first
glimpse(babynames)
head(babynames)

# select() - Choose columns
select(babynames, name)
select(babynames, name, sex)
select(babynames, name:n)           # Range of columns
select(babynames, starts_with("n"))  # Columns starting with "n"
select(babynames, -prop)            # Exclude prop column
select(babynames, -c(year, sex, prop))  # Exclude multiple

# filter() - Choose rows
filter(babynames, name == "Khaleesi")
filter(babynames, name == "Sea" | name == "Anemone")
filter(babynames, prop > 0.08)
filter(babynames, year == 1880, (n == 5 | n == 6))
filter(babynames, name %in% c("Acura", "Lexus", "Yugo"))

# arrange() - Sort rows
arrange(babynames, n)
arrange(babynames, n, prop)
arrange(babynames, year, desc(prop))
arrange(babynames, desc(year), desc(prop))
```


## Using the Pipe `|>` Operator  

### Chaining Operations  

```{r pipe-operations, eval=FALSE}
# Traditional nested approach (hard to read)
arrange(select(filter(babynames, year == 2017, sex == "M"), name, n), desc(n))

# Using pipes (much clearer!)
babynames |>
  filter(year == 2017, sex == "M") |>
  select(name, n) |>
  arrange(desc(n))

# Try different combinations
babynames |>
  filter(name == "Emma") |>
  arrange(year) |>
  select(year, n, prop)

babynames |>
  filter(year >= 2010) |>
  select(name, year, n) |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  head(10)
```



## Summarising Data  

### Using `summarise()` and `group_by()`  

```{r summarising-data, eval=FALSE}
# Basic summaries
babynames |>
  filter(name == "Thomas", sex == "M") |>
  summarise(
    total = sum(n), 
    max = max(n), 
    mean = mean(n),
    years = n_distinct(year)
  )

# When did Khaleesi first appear?
babynames |>
  filter(name == "Khaleesi") |>
  summarise(first_year = first(year))

# Overall dataset summary
babynames |>
  summarise(
    total_names = n(),
    distinct_names = n_distinct(name),
    years_covered = n_distinct(year)
  )

# Group summaries
babynames |>
  group_by(year, sex) |>
  summarise(total_births = sum(n), .groups = "drop") |>
  arrange(year)

babynames |>
  group_by(name, sex) |>
  summarise(total = sum(n), .groups = "drop") |>
  arrange(desc(total)) |>
  head(10)
```

## Creating New Variables  

### Using mutate()  

```{r mutate-examples, eval=FALSE}
# Add new columns
babynames |>
  mutate(births = n / prop) |>
  select(year, name, n, prop, births) |>
  head()

# Complex calculations
babynames |>
  group_by(year) |>
  mutate(year_total = sum(n)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  mutate(
    fraction = n / year_total,
    percentage = fraction * 100
  ) |>
  select(year, name, n, year_total, percentage) |>
  arrange(desc(percentage)) |>
  head()

# Find peak popularity for each name
babynames |>
  group_by(name) |>
  mutate(
    peak_n = max(n),
    is_peak = n == peak_n
  ) |>
  filter(is_peak) |>
  select(name, year, n, prop) |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  head()
```

# Practice Problems  

## Problem 1: Fix the Code  

What's wrong with the following code? Can you fix it?

```{r fix-code, eval=FALSE, error=TRUE}
# Problem code:
filter(babynames, name = "Sea")
filter(babynames, name == Sea)
```

**Your corrected code:**
```{r fix-code-student, eval=FALSE}
# Fixed code here:


```

**Your explanation of what was wrong:**



## Problem 2: Most Popular Names  

Which name was the most popular for a single gender in a single year? Compare arranging by `prop` vs `n`.

```{r popular-names-student, eval=FALSE}
# Your code to find highest proportion:


# Your code to find highest count:


```

**Your analysis:**
- Are the results the same? Why or why not?



## Problem 3: Popular Girls Names in 2017  

Write a pipeline that will:

1. Filter `babynames` to just girls born in 2017
2. Select the name and n columns  
3. Arrange so most popular names are at the top

```{r girls-2017-student, eval=FALSE}
# Your pipeline here:


```


# Tidy Data with `tidyr`  

## Understanding Tidy Data  

Explore the concept of tidy data using built-in datasets from `tidyr`. Each dataset represents the same information organised differently.

```{r tidy-data-explore-student, eval=FALSE}
# Load tidyr (part of tidyverse)
library(tidyr)

# Look at different representations of the same data
table1
table2  
table3
table4a  # Cases
table4b  # Population
```

**Your analysis:**
- Which table is "tidy"? Why?
- What problems do you see with the other tables?
- How would you describe what each row and column represents in each table?

*Write your analysis here:*



## Pivoting Data: Lengthening and Widening  

```{r pivoting-student, eval=FALSE}
# Convert wide to long format
table4a_long <- table4a |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(`1999`, `2000`),    # Columns to pivot
    names_to = "year",           # Name for the key column
    values_to = "cases"          # Name for the value column
  )
table4a_long

# Convert back to wide format
table4a_long |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year,           # Column to get names from
    values_from = cases          # Column to get values from
  )

# Try with table4b (population data)
table4b_long <- table4b |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(`1999`, `2000`),
    names_to = "year", 
    values_to = "population"
  )
table4b_long
```


## Practice with Real Data  

### Case study: Cholesterol Study  

Convert this dataset to long format and calculate summary statistics for each group.

```{r cholesterol-data-student, eval=FALSE}
# Create the dataset
cholesterol_data <- tibble(
  oat_bran_free = c(4.61, 5.42, 5.40, 4.54, 3.98), 
  oat_bran = c(3.64, 5.57, 4.85, 4.80, 3.68)
)
cholesterol_data

# Your tasks:
# 1. Convert to long format
# 2. Calculate n, mean, and standard deviation for each diet group
```

```{r cholesterol-solution-student, eval=FALSE}
# Task 1 - Convert to long format:


# Task 2 - Calculate summary statistics:


```

**Your interpretation:**
- Which diet appears to result in lower cholesterol?
- What do the standard deviations tell you?

*Write your analysis here:*



## Advanced Tidy Data Problems  

Sketch out the process to calculate the `rate` for `table2` and `table3`. You need to:

a. Extract TB cases per country per year
b. Extract matching population per country per year  
c. Divide cases by population, multiply by 10000
d. Store back in appropriate place

**Hint:** For `table3`, you may find the function `separate_wider_delim` helpful.

```{r calculate-rates-student, eval=FALSE}
# Your approach for table2:


# Your approach for table3:


```

**Your explanation:**
- What's the main challenge with each table format?
- Which approach was easier to implement?
